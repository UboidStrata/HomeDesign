# HomeDesign
This is our first complete MRTK project, and it was the HomeDesign project.

<h2> How to run </h2>



1) Download Assets and ProjectSettings folders, they both are necessary.*
2) Extract them and place them in a folder, that folder will become your project folder
3) Apply Mixed Reality Feature Tool on that project folder
4) Open Unity Hub, press open, and select that new to-be project folder
5) Go through the necessary settings for OpenXR and specifically HoloLens2 configurations.
6) Apply any edits Unity suggests and it should be good to run

**You can either download the zip file and remove the Packages folder or include it and proceed with adjusting the settings, below describes more.*

The Packages folder contains the files added by the Mixed Reality Feature Tool, and so it may save time to just use that folder in addition to the other 2, with some minor fixing/setting up of OpenXR in the unity project to match the correct project settings to preview the scene correctly.
